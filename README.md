# SkillsUSA-Nationals-2016
The two programs we made in the NLSC computer programming competition 2016. I ended up taking first place. Although the two programs are fairly simplistic (due to the time limit), they were subject to rigorous evaluation by professionals from the industry.

# Food Program
This program allows you to choose the number of each item you'd like, and calculates the total price. It will also display the cumulative total of sales for that session.

# Grades Program
You can input any amount of grades for each class, and then calculate the high, low, and average for each class. This is all presented with an intuitive GUI.
